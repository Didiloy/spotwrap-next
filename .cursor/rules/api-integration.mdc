# API Integration and Rate Limiting

## Spotify API Integration

The application integrates with the Spotify Web API through the following key components:

### Rate Limiting Implementation

- Rate limiting is implemented in [api/spotify.go](mdc:api/spotify.go)
- Uses a token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Default rate limit: 100 requests per minute
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Graceful handling of rate limit responses

### API Endpoints

Key endpoints used:
- Artist details: `/v1/artists/{id}`
- Artist albums: `/v1/artists/{id}/albums`
- Artist top tracks: `/v1/artists/{id}/top-tracks`
- Album details: `/v1/albums/{id}`
- Track details: `/v1/tracks/{id}`

### Token Management

- Access tokens are automatically refreshed every 55 minutes
- Token refresh is handled in [app.go](mdc:app.go)
- Credentials are securely stored in the database
- Token expiration is tracked and managed

## Best Practices

1. Always use the rate limiter for API calls
2. Implement retry logic for failed requests
3. Handle rate limit responses gracefully
4. Cache responses when appropriate
5. Use background processing for non-critical updates
