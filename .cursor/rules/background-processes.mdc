# Background Processes and Notifications

## Background Checking

The application implements background processes for checking new releases:

### Implementation Details

- Background checker runs every 5 hours
- Managed in [app.go](mdc:app.go)
- Uses goroutines for concurrent processing
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Tracks last checked time for each artist

### Process Flow

1. Fetch artists from database
2. Check each artist's latest releases
3. Compare release dates with last checked time
4. Send notifications for new releases
5. Update last checked timestamp

## Notification System

### Desktop Notifications

- Implemented in [notifications/notifications.go](mdc:notifications/notifications.go)
- Cross-platform support
- Customizable notification content
- Handles notification permissions

### Notification Content

- Artist name
- Release name
- Release type (album/single)
- Release date
- Optional: Album artwork

## Best Practices

1. Use background processing for non-blocking operations
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Log background process activities
4. Handle application shutdown gracefully
5. Respect system notification settings
